# Have you ever wondered if something was a palindrome? Wonder no longer at Palindrome Checker!

On my journey to learn all the secrets of JS, https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn offered me this challange!

* Check if taco cat is a palindrome
* Sort by all players, forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers
* This was mainly used as a teaching device for destructuring, so not a ton of fun for viewsers
